# Dev2025

Welcome to the Dev2025 repository! This is a collaborative space for our developers' group to contribute, experiment, and build projects together.

## Guidelines

1. **Branches**  
   - Each developer should create their own branch for work.  
   - Branch naming convention: `feature/<your-name>` or `bugfix/<your-name>`.

2. **Commits**  
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.  
   - Follow the format: `type(scope): description`. Example: `feat(auth): add login validation`.

3. **Pull Requests**  
   - Create a pull request (PR) when you want to merge your branch into `main`.  
   - Ensure your code is reviewed before merging.

4. **Code Style**  
   - Follow consistent coding standards for readability.  
   - Run linters/tests before pushing changes.

5. **Issues**  
   - Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests.  
   - Assign yourself when working on an issue.
